# Air Rush
A twist on the classic Flappy Bird game — this time, you're flying a **plane**, dodging obstacles, collecting coins, and climbing the **leaderboard**! The game gets progressively harder as you go. Coins don’t change gameplay, but they're shown next to your name on the leaderboard as a bragging right.
